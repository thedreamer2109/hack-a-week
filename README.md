HACKATHON


IDEA;
An app which can track all the ambulances in a locality.
Whenever there is a scientific emergency , with the aid of the use of this app we can get the close by ambulance in shortest viable time.
The app consists of following elements as well:

*Notify police forces
*Lead through least site visitors area(route optimisation)
*Bed and health practitioner availability in precise hospital
*Different priorities for fundamental and emergency needs

An undertaking used to be initiated by way of the authorities of Kerala to tune all government ambulances in the state (accessible solely to the government). We advise to create an app to track ambulances (government and private) in a locality which is accessible to the users. It allows customers to contact the nearest ambulances in the shortest time. The app consists of the following features:
- Creating a user communication platform with the driver of the ambulance
This is integral to understand the place the user is precisely positioned
-Drivers details would be provided to the user.
	This displays: a photo of your driver, the vehicleâ€™s make, model and license plate number.
- Getting time of arrival of the ambulance at the pickup point and having a hassle-free trip to your destination.
-Information about blood availability
	To connect, digitize and streamline the workflow of bloodbanks across the nation. You can get information about nearby camps, bloodbanks, blood donors etc..
-Prioritise the severity of the situation of the user
-Doctor and mattress availability in hospitals close to the region supplied to driver
	This feature allows patients to have prior knowledge about the condition of the hospital and number of doctors available . This helps to prevent shifting of patients to other hospitals due to unavailability of healthcare workers, medicines, beds etc.
-Lead through least traffic area:
Vehicular traffic congestion is an emergent problem in many cities around the world. Recent studies have shown that vehicular traffic re-routing is one of the key solutions to handle this problem, which is about suggesting alternative routes to improve the overall traffic efficiency.
-Notify the nearest police stations of the circumstance of the user and route taken by means of the driver. This is essential for police officers to track the ambulances and ensure safety of the patients.
-An app for drivers to communicate with users and to get location of users based on priority.
-Special healthcare facilities for pregnant women.
